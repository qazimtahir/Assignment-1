//Q5. Famous Quote 2: Repeat Exercise 4, but this time store the famous personâ€™s name in a variable called famous_person. Then compose your message and store it in a new variable called message. Print your message.

//SOLUTION

let famous_person: string = "William Shakespeare";
let message: string =
  '"There is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so."';
// results using concatenation
console.log(famous_person + " said in Hemlet, " + message);

// results using Template Literals
console.log(`${famous_person} said in Hemlet, ${message}`);
